## About infra.run
 How it started:
  * Early 2019: First ideas to do a Hosting Coop (*"Hey, I've got some spare RIPE IP space!"*) with an attitude
  * Dec 2019: Cyber4Edu founded
  * 2000: Pandemic hits
  * First baby steps with a larger over-the-weekend conference
  * No way we do this by hand: Enter Ansible, noemis role
  * Coop gets deferred for a Limited Liability Company (GmbH)
---
## About infra.run (Cont'd)
 How it's going:
  * Running a significant BBB cluster
  * Revamping Lernraum Berlin (SSO, GDPR-compliant retention policy)
  * Soon offering a complete Open Source based offering for schools (SSO, LMS, Storage, Website Publishing, ...)
  * Everything we do or host is Open Source
  * Limited Liability Company finally goes Coop
---
## Choosing BigBlueButton
  * C4E tried Jitsi -> did not scale
  * BBB offered a lot of what our users needed
    * Moodle integration
    * Whiteboard
    * Moderation features
---
## BBB Bootstrapping
 * Start out with VMs
 * Scale out to a few hundered VMs (Intel, 8 Dedi Cores)
   * Each is good for up to 120 users
   * Each has a companion VM for TURN
 * Quick to ramp up and maintain
 * Rather expensive
 * Reevaluate Costs
---
## BBB Bootstrapping (Cont'd)
 * Rent 100 physical servers (AMD Ryzen 9 3900 12-Core)
   * Each is good for up to 150 users
   * Way below potential
 * Optimize heavily
   * Reduce Cursor update rates
   * Roll out TUC-BBB-HTML5-Packages for 2.2
   * Productize 2.3 early
   * Now each is good for up to 300 users
---
## Challenges (and how we solved them)
 The 8am problem (less utilized capacity in total)
 ![Grafana graph](img/8am.png)
---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 The "All Hands on Cam" problem (even less utilized capacity)
 * Teacher wants everyone to turn on cams (30+ kids)
 * Esp. popular with primary school teachers
 * Lots of entering into and returning from Breakout Rooms
 * 2.2: Kurento says no
 * 2.3: Kurento says yes (but only every so often)

---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 Teachers and Technology
 * Dial-In needed, cluster wide
 * We delivered ([Ansible SIP-GW role](https://gitlab.com/infra.run/public/ansible-sipgw))
  * Prohibit Anonymous Calls
  * Allow first joiner to dial in without anyone joining via Mic first (part of EBBA role now)
---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 Security
 * Systemd permissions were off
   * Service files owned by service users
     * Implicit PrivEsc (!)
   * Reported responsibly, mitigated via Ansible
   * Unfortunately, we saw regressions
 * Freeswitch with full config
   * Trim down
   * Harden via AppArmor
---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 Nodes fail Echo Test
 * Write [BBB Selenium Exporter](https://gitlab.com/infra.run/public/bbb-selenium-exporter/)
 * Used to run Echo Tests periodically on all hosts and report to Prometheus
 * On failure, drain node, reboot and rejoin node
---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 * BBB has no concept of multiple tenants in a cluster
 * Did I meantion we had badly utilized capacity?
 * Sharing the secret is a no-go
 * Lots of little Clusters (well, three...), lots of wasted compute
 * Enter b3scale!
---
## b3scale - A multi tenancy BBB scaling frontend
 * Written in Go
 * Really fast operations (batch enable/disable/removal)
 * "Frontends" (tenants) and "Backend" (nodes)
 * Tags (examples see next slide)
 * Agent process reports actual load (b3scalenoded)
 * Monitoring (Prometheus) support
---
## b3scale (Cont'd)

 * Usecases for tags
   * *"Frontend friendly_user_A can only use backends tagged bbb_23"*
   * *"Frontent A can only use backends tagged 'A_exclusive'"*
 * Currently in development: HTTP API
 * Next up: Support for Recordings
 * Experimental support for hiding nodes
   * XXXX.bbb.infra.run -> bbb.infra.run
   * XXXX.bbb.infra.run -> conference.tenant.org

## Success Factors
 * Fast implementation/pickup
  * (TODO) Example: Translation of waiting page
  * (TODO) Example: Discard Notification
 * The Community (esp. BigBlueButton-DE Matrix Channel)
---
## Things to improve
 * Packaging (working on it)
 * The Kurento Situation (maybe 2.4?)
 * Scheduled/Predictable Rooms/Dial-In
 * Migration of running sessions
 * Whiteboard Export
 * iOS Support ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
## Shoutouts
 * Blindside and the BBB community
 * noemis
 * Senfcall
 * schrd @ TU Chemnitz
 * EBBA
 * *BrutalBirdie* for backporting patches to EBBA

## Thank you!
