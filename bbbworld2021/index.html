## Contents

  * About me and infra.run
  * Challenges (and our solutions)
    * BBB related
    * Social issues
    * External factors
  * Outlook

## About me
  ![danimo](img/danimo_square.jpg)
  * Software Engineer by trade
    * KDE → Trolltech/Nokia → Nextcloud → SUSE
  * Video person by hobby ([C3VOC](https://c3voc.de))
  * Sysadmin at heart
  * Author by accident  
  * Living in Berlin
---
## About infra.run
 How it started:
  * Early 2019: First ideas to do a Hosting Coop (*"Hey, I've got some spare RIPE IP space!"*) with an attitude
  * Dec 2019: Cyber4Edu founded
  * 2020: Pandemic hits
  * First steps hosting a educational exchange event
    * No way we do this by hand: Ansible, noemis role
  * Coop gets deferred → Limited Liability Company (GmbH)
---
## About infra.run (Cont'd)
 How it's going:
  * Running a large BBB cluster serving public schools in Berlin, Bavaria and schools in other states
  * Revamping Lernraum Berlin (SSO, GDPR-compliant retention policy)
  * Setting up our own datacenter
  * Everything we do or host is Open Source
---
## Choosing BigBlueButton
  * C4E tried Jitsi → did not scale
  * BBB offered a lot of what our users needed
    * Moodle integration
    * Whiteboard
    * Moderation features
---
## BBB Bootstrapping
 * Started out with VMs
 * Scaled out to a few hundred VMs (Intel, 8 dedi. Cores)
   * Each is good for ~120 users (avg)
   * Each has a companion VM for TURN
 * Quick to ramp up and maintain
 * Rather expensive
 * Time to reevaluate costs
---
## BBB Bootstrapping (Cont'd)
 * Rent 100 physical servers (AMD Ryzen 9 3900 12-Core)
   * Each is good for 150 users (avg)
   * Way below potential
 * Optimize heavily
   * Reduce update rate
   * Roll out TUC-BBB-HTML5-Packages for 2.2
   * Productize 2.3 early
   * Now each is good for up to 300 users (avg)
 * Predicting quality of service still hard
---
## Challenges (and how we solved them)
 The 8am problem (less utilized capacity in total)
 ![Grafana graph](img/8am.png)
---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 The "All Hands on Cam" problem (even less utilized capacity)
 * Teacher wants everyone to turn on cams (30+ kids)
 * Esp. popular with primary school teachers
 * Lots of entering into and returning from Breakout Rooms
 * 2.2: Kurento says no
 * 2.3: Kurento says yes (but only every so often)
---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 The Greedy ISP problem
 * In March, our hoster contacted us
 * Deutsche Telekom (40-50% of our traffic) has a double paid traffic scheme
   * Tier 1 transit costs also for DTAG AS (!)
 * Massive BBB traffic busted hosters calculations
 * Consequences: All included traffic zeroed, special traffic pricing for BBB servers
---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 The Incompetent ISP problem
 * Vodafone.de rolled out FW update for their cable customers that broke BBB
 * Workarounds
   * Disable HW offload
   * Request downgrade / upgrade to beta
 * Huge support load
 * Lots of shared pain in the BBB.de community
---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 Teachers and Technology
 * Dial-In needed, cluster wide
 * We delivered ([Ansible SIP-GW role](https://gitlab.com/infra.run/public/ansible-sipgw))
   * Anonymous call blocking
   * Allow first joiner to dial in without anyone joining via mic first (part of EBBA role now)
---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 Security
 * Systemd permissions were off
   * Service files owned by service users
     * Implicit PrivEsc (!)
   * Reported responsibly, mitigated via Ansible
   * Unfortunately, we saw regressions
 * Freeswitch with full config
   * Trim down
   * Harden via AppArmor
---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 Nodes fail Echo Test
 * Write [BBB Selenium Exporter](https://gitlab.com/infra.run/public/bbb-selenium-exporter/)
 * Used to run Echo Tests periodically on all hosts and report to Prometheus
 * On failure, drain, reboot and rejoin node
---
## Challenges (Cont'd)
 * Scalite has no concept of multiple tenants
 * Sharing the secret is a no-go
 * Did I mention we had badly utilized capacity?
 * Lots of little clusters (well, three...), lots of wasted compute
 * Enter b3scale!
---
## b3scale — A multi tenancy BBB scaling frontend
 * Written in Go
 * Development supported through Prototype Fund (BMBF, OKF)
 * Really fast operations
 * "Frontends" (tenants) and "Backend" (nodes)
 * Tags (examples see next slide)
 * Agent process reports actual load (b3scalenoded)
 * Monitoring (Prometheus) support
---
## b3scale (Cont'd)

 * Use cases for tags
   * *"Frontend friendly_user_A can only use backends tagged bbb_23"*
   * *"Frontent A can only use backends tagged 'A_exclusive'"*
 * Currently in development: HTTP API
 * Next up: Support for recordings
 * Experimental support for hiding nodes
   * XXXX.bbb.infra.run →  bbb.infra.run
   * XXXX.bbb.infra.run →  conference.tenant.org

## Success Factors
 * Fast implementation/pickup
   * Translation of waiting page
   * Discard notification
     ![End Meeting Dialog](img/endmeeting.png)
 * The Community (esp. BigBlueButton-DE Matrix Channel)
---
## Things to Improve
 * Packaging (working on it)
 * The Kurento Situation (maybe 2.4?)
 * Scheduled/Predictable Rooms/Dial-In
 * Migration of running sessions
 * Whiteboard export
 * iOS Support ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
## Lessons learned
 * Always audit your software
   * It's the strength of Open Source. Use it!
 * Anticipate external factors (ISPs)
   * Threatening business model
   * Increasing support load
 * Virtualization is expensive, and of little benefit
 * Make sure to understand exactly how your use case differs from others
   * multiple tenants + customer-hosted frontends 
 * Open Source works
---
## The future for infra.run
  * Limited Liability Company finally goes Coop
  * Offering a complete Open Source-based solution for schools\

## Shout-Outs
 * Blindside and the BBB community
 * noemis
 * Senfcall
 * schrd @ TU Chemnitz
 * EBBA
 * *BrutalBirdie* for backporting patches to EBBA
 * lukas2511 for digging into security-related issues

## Thank you!
